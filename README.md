# Mobile Applications 2 Project TOMAS BRAZAS G00349242

A Windows Cross-Platform application that will test your luck as you battle the beast to improve your score. RNG Fighter 
is a game that I've chosen to develop and design. Game consists of tapping buttons that will either have no effect or will hit
the beast earning you points. Project has been coded using Xamarin and Visual Studio 17.


# Architecture
The application is made up of 3 main pages that are navigationable by the user. Background music is implemented that can be muted/unmuted by the user. I've attempted a JSON storage that would save/load the user's progress. Application is created using Xamarin.



A test plan and design documents are included in this project.
